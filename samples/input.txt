NEW: The New Has Arrived!

-----> “The old life is gone; a new life has begun.”
2 Corinthians 5:17b (NVT)

"You cannot live the fullness of a new life while still carrying old sinful habits."
– Carlito Paes

With Jesus, everything becomes NEW!

-----> “Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!”
2 Corinthians 5:17 (NIV)

-----> “See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it?”
Isaiah 43:19 (NIV)

THE NEW FREEDOM

-----> “It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery.”
Galatians 5:1 (NIV)

“I know of but one freedom, and that is the freedom of the mind.”
– Antoine de Saint-Exupéry
(French writer, illustrator, and pilot)

I don’t know your opinion on this quote by the writer, but from a human perspective, I agree with him. Everyone who is “free” in this world but has not yet encountered the true freedom in Christ is still bound—whether by sin, addictions, dependencies, or co-dependencies in some form.
IN LIFE, YOU EITHER CHOOSE TO BE A SLAVE OF CHRIST OR ALLOW YOURSELF TO BE A SLAVE TO THE WORLD AND TO SATAN.
While we live in this world, we need to live out God’s newness—
Standing firm in the freedom in Christ, day by day.

• INTRODUCTION: The Context of the Letter to the Galatians
•	The apostle Paul writes to a church influenced by Judaizing teachers, who taught that faith in Christ needed to be supplemented by adherence to the Mosaic Law (circumcision, rituals, and other practices).
•	The epistle is a passionate appeal for believers to remain in the true gospel: salvation by grace through faith, not by the works of the law.
•	The highlighted verse is a hymn of victory celebrating the freedom of faith in Christ, leaving behind the burdens of religiosity and its prisons.

TO RECEIVE GOD’S NEW FREEDOM IN YOUR LIFE…
1. HAVE AN ATTITUDE OF PERSEVERANCE AND CONSISTENCY: v.1a

“Therefore” connects with the previous argument: Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law (Galatians 3:13) and from its guardianship (Galatians 4:4–7).

Now, each new day, take hold of the freedom won at the CROSS, given to you by God’s grace as His BELOVED CHILD.

“Stand firm” (στῆκετε / stēkete) — a military term implying holding one's position against enemy attack.

This is an active exhortation: Christian freedom must be DEFINED, EMBRACED, AND SUSTAINED.

You will face daily pressures to abandon that freedom.

The new “Freedom” in Christ refers to being set free:
•	From the condemnation of the LAW.
•	From the slavery of SIN.
•	From the need for SELF-JUSTIFICATION through works.

Standing firm in freedom requires vigilance:
•	Beware of false doctrines and religious impositions that undermine grace.
•	We must not exchange loving obedience for religious conformity or spiritual meritocracy.
•	Beware of false prophets who preach faith as a license to sin.

2. BELIEVE THAT THE NEW FREEDOM IS FINAL: v.1b
“For Christ has truly set us free.”

•	Emphasis on the complete and effective action of Christ:

“Christ has set us free” (Greek aorist tense) indicates something already accomplished.

•	This freedom was won by Jesus on the cross, not through human merit.
•	“Truly” (or “for freedom”) shows that the purpose of this liberation is to live as free people—in relationship with God, not in slavery to empty religion.

The Work of Christ on the CROSS is absolute,

THE NEW FREEDOM IS FULL AND ETERNAL!

Jesus said:

-----> “My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand.”
John 10:27–29 (NIV)

THEREFORE, ONCE SAVED IN CHRIST, SAVED FOREVER!

3. DO NOT ACCEPT GOING BACK TO THE OLD LIFE: v.1c

“Do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery.”

•	Paul uses the language of slavery to describe the attempt to be justified by works.
•	“Again” implies that they were previously enslaved (as Gentiles under paganism or Jews under the weight of the Law).
•	It is a warning against spiritual regression — a legalistic gospel is a step backward.

• CONCLUSION:

And in conclusion, I want to affirm this to you today…

Christian freedom is spiritual and relational
•	The new freedom is not license, but freedom from sin and guilt.
•	It is freedom to love, serve, worship, and obey God out of gratitude.

BELIEVE, DECLARE, AND LIVE IT: THE CROSS IS ENOUGH!

•	Nothing needs to be added to what Christ has done.
•	Faith is the only path to justification—and this truth should shape our preaching, discipleship, and community life.
•	Christ set us free to live as sons and daughters, not as slaves.
•	True freedom is remaining in grace, rejecting every burden that seeks to replace Christ’s sufficiency.

The new freedom has given us an inheritance and a father-son relationship:

-----> “...Giving joyful thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of his holy people in the kingdom of light. For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves.”
Colossians 1:12–13 (NIV)
